# SBFT Python Tool Competition Runner

![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ThunderKey/python-tool-competition-2024/actions/workflows/check.yaml/badge.svg)

The Workshop on [The 17th International Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT)](https://sbft24.github.io/)
offers a Python tool competition on automatic test generation for the Python programming
language.

## Important Dates

- Submission: XY
- Workshop: XY

## Overview

In general, manual testing of software systems is costly.
Automatic test generation for Python lowers barriers to
test and ensure quality for Python software.
Therefore, the SBFT initiates a competition on Python test generation,
which enhances research and implementation for novel test generators for Python.
This repository provides the necessary facilities and guidelines
for participating in the SBFT Python tool competition.

## Test Generator Implementation

The platform provides an API for writing test cases.
You simply need to generate a `string` that represent the body of Python
testing module that tests a given target.
Below you see how to use the platform to implement a generator.

## Usage

### Installation

This tool requires at least Python 3.9 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

`pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/ThunderKey/python-tool-competition-2024.git`
(until made public)

### Creating a New Test Generator Project

Run `python-tool-competition-2024 init` and follow the instructions on the screen.
During the setup process, you need to provide the following information:

- Human-readable name of the test generator (mandatory)
- Directory in which the project will be created (by default: the current directory)
- Your full name (mandatory)
- Your email address (mandatory)
- Information required to create `pyproject.toml`:
  - Project's version (by default 0.1.0)
  - Author (by default, it will use the information provided in the prior steps)
  - Licence (optional)
  - Compatible Python versions for your generator
  - Project's main dependencies (can be defined during the setup or afterward)
  - Project's development dependencies (can be defined during the setup or afterward)

This will create a [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) project with all
required files.
It creates a template of the generator and exposes it as a plugin of the
competition runner.

Additionally, some very basic example targets are created as well.
You can add your own files to the `targets` directory.

Now you can implement the `build_test` function of your generator.
This will be called for each target file and it expects that either a
`TestGenerationSuccess` or `TestGenerationFailure` is returned.
The success contains the body of the generated test file.
Storing the file is handled by the runner that runs `build_test`.
The failure contains a reason and lines that describe the failure.

### Running inside of the Project

Inside of the create project run
`poetry run python-tool-competition-2024 run <generator name>`.
This will start the test generation process.

With `poetry run python-tool-competition-2024 run -h` you can find out what
generators were detected.

The tool does not only execute the test generator, it also runs the generated tests
against the code to measure different metrics: it measures line and branch coverage
using the [coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) framework;
it furthermore computes [mutation score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing)
utilizing the [cosmic-ray](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray) tool.

After finishing the test generation process, the script will print the
information regarding the coverage achieved by the tests generated by your tool.
It will also save these data as `XML` files in the `<generator name>/coverages`
directory.

## Improving the Competition Runner

- Installation: `poetry install`
- Testing: `tox` (`tox -p auto` for parallel execution)
- Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) if possible.
